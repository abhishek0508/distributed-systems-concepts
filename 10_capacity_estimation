find amount of storage needed by youtube daily

assumptions
    no of users 1 billion
    2 hrs of vides aquires 0.4gb or 400mb
    (it can based on torrent file size, like 2 hrs movies 1.1gb-800mb)

    how many users are uploading the video?, 
    lets assume, (1/1000) are uploading, can be different
    hence total users uploading videos 
    (10*9) *(1/1000) = 10^6 videos,

    hence,
    assumption lets assume, each videos is 10 mins,
    based on above assumption each video size is 40mb 

    hence total video size is -> (10^6*40)

    Now, replication for fault tolerance and faster reads, 
    3 times -> 3*10^6*40

    Also, different quality leads to 2 times, -> 2*3*10^6*40

Estimating cache requirements,
    what to cache?
    thumbnails & captions 
    size of thubnails -> 10kb, captions 10kb

    of all contents, for last 90 days
    90 * 10Kb * (10^6)(per days) -> 1TB

    no of computers  = 1TB/(16GB) => 64 nodes, 
    
    can't have entire capacity, also fault tolerance hence => (64*3)*2
    500 nodes with 16GB ram as cache
