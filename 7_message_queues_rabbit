message queues brings use of asynchronous behaviour to systems
where you don't have to wait for immediate response isn't need, rather a confirmation
that your request will be served.

Messaging Queues provide useful features such as persistence, routing and task management.

suppose you get lot of request's from client to serve
or, you made network call which is supposed to have heavy processing,
or, you need to update your UI(:p, javascript)

this requests can be put into message queues from where system can take requests one by one
and can process this one by one
