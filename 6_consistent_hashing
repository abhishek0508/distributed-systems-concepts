where to send the request if we have many servers?
this managing of where to send request is load balancing

this sending of request evenly across all server can be done using consistent hashing

process -> request id from 0 to M-1
now this request id is hashed, and then we do mod
h(r1) = m1%N
(N) = no of servers

this gets us the which server is used to serve the request
this hash function is uniformly random, hence the request gets mapped uniformly to
servers, 

now, a new server gets added to the existing set of servers, 
this sudden change in no of servers, make chanage of mapping from request id to servers
in huge amount, which is not desireable, 

this problem is solved by creating by a circular data strcuture, in which both request id
and server id is mapped, now request id is served by the nearest server id in the circular track.


now, again there may be a problem when a server goes down, it may possible that a single server
now serves half of the load, how to solve this?

we create virtual server(not really), we create K hashing functions, we get K server id's
to be mapped on circular track for a single serve.
