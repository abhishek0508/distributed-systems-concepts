Content delivery network
Introduction
    A content delivery network (CDN) is a globally distributed network of proxy servers,
    serving content from locations closer to the user. Generally, static files such 
    as HTML/CSS/JS, photos, and videos are served from CDN, although some CDNs such as 
    Amazon's CloudFront support dynamic content. The site's DNS resolution will tell 
    clients which server to contact.

Push CDNs
    Push CDNs receive new content whenever changes occur on your server. 

Pull CDNs
    Pull CDNs grab new content from your server when the first user requests the content.
